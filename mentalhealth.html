                Client: Kent State University.
            </p>
            <p>
                Skills used: Drupal CMS, HTML, CSS, Adobe XD.
            </p>
            <p>
                From the sold prototype created in Adobe XD to the launch of the KSU Mental Health Hub in March 2023, I was honored to have been the web designer behind the scenes of such an important project.
            </p>
			<p>
				In October 2023, when Kent State celebrated its 2nd Annual Mental Health Awareness Month, a mixed media campaign was launched directing traffic to the website I had made. It was truly an incredible experience that I am so fortunate to have been a part of.
